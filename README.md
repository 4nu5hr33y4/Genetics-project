# Genetics-project
Project pipeline
- have Fragaria iinumae genome assembly in contig stage and will be validating
- started looking for potential softwares, a few of those are: 
    - flye software 
    - BiscoT software by Bionano genomics

update
4/22/2022
we now have a de novo asembly of the frageria illumne chromosomes. 
It is pobssible to analyze the nucloetides to validate the sequence. 

we can:
    -validate curent contigs
    -form our own contigs
    
    we should probabaly select the task we could most comfortable finish in a week
